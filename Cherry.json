"A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit).\nCommercial cherries are obtained from cultivars of several species, such as the sweet Prunus avium and the sour Prunus cerasus. The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in \"ornamental cherry\" or \"cherry blossom.\" Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although Prunus avium is often referred to specifically by the name \"wild cherry\" in the British Isles.\n\n\n== Botany ==\n\n\n=== True cherries ===\n\nPrunus subg. Cerasus contains species that are typically called cherries. They are known as true cherries and distinguished by having a single winter bud per axil, by having the flowers in small corymbs or umbels of several together (occasionally solitary, e.g. P. serrula; some species with short racemes, e.g. P. maacki), and by having smooth fruit with no obvious groove. Examples of true cherries are:\n\nPrunus apetala (Siebold & Zucc.) Franch. & Sav. \u2013 clove cherry\nPrunus avium (L.) L. \u2013 sweet cherry, wild cherry, mazzard or gean\nPrunus campanulata Maxim. \u2013 Taiwan cherry, Formosan cherry or bell-flowered cherry\nPrunus canescens Bois. \u2013 grey-leaf cherry\nPrunus cerasus L. \u2013 sour cherry\nPrunus emarginata (Douglas ex Hook.)

Ingram \u2013 Oshima cherry\nPrunus takesimensis Nakai \u2013 Ulleungdo cherry\nPrunus yedoensis Matsum. \u2013 Yoshino cherry or Tokyo cherry\n\n\n=== Bush cherries ===\n\nBush cherries are characterized by having three winter buds per axil. They used to be included in Prunus subg. Cerasus, but phylogenetic research indicates they should be a section of Prunus subg. Prunus. Examples of bush cherries are:\n\nPrunus cistena Koehne \u2013 purple-leaf sand cherry\nPrunus humilis Bunge \u2013 Chinese plum-cherry or humble bush cherry\nPrunus japonica Thunb. \u2013 Korean cherry\nPrunus prostrata Labill. \u2013 mountain cherry, rock cherry, spreading cherry or prostrate cherry\nPrunus pumila L. \u2013 sand cherry\nPrunus tomentosa Thunb. \u2013 Nanking cherry, Manchu cherry, downy cherry, Shanghai cherry, Ando cherry, mountain cherry, Chinese dwarf cherry, Chinese bush cherry\n\n\n=== Bird cherries, cherry laurels, and other racemose cherries ===\n\nPrunus subg. Padus contains most racemose species that are called cherries which used to be included in the genera Padus (bird cherries), Laurocerasus (cherry laurels), Pygeum (tropical species such as African cherry) and Maddenia. Examples of the racemose cherries are:\n\nPrunus africana (Hook.f.) Kalkman \u2013 African cherry\nPrunus caroliniana Aiton \u2013 Carolina laurel cherry or laurel cherry\nPrunus cornuta (Wall. ex Royle) Steud. \u2013 Himalayan bird cherry\nPrunus grayana Maxim. \u2013 Japanese bird cherry or Gray's bird cherry\nPrunus ilicifolia (Nutt. ex Hook. & Arn.)

A cultivated cherry is recorded as having been brought to Rome by Lucius Licinius Lucullus from northeastern Anatolia, also known as the Pontus region, in 72 BC.\nCherries were introduced into England at Teynham, near Sittingbourne in Kent, by order of Henry VIII, who had tasted them in Flanders.\nCherries, along with many other fruiting trees and plants, probably first arrived in North America around 1606 in the New France colony of Port Royal, which is modern-day Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. Richard Guthrie described in 1629, the \"fruitful valley adorned with...great variety of fruit trees, chestnuts, pears, apples, cherries, plums and all other fruits.\"\n\n\n== Cultivation ==\n\nThe cultivated forms are of the species sweet cherry (P. avium) to which most cherry cultivars belong, and the sour cherry (P. cerasus), which is used mainly for cooking. Both species originate in Europe and western Asia; they usually do not cross-pollinate. Some other species, although having edible fruit, are not grown extensively for consumption, except in northern regions where the two main species will not grow. Irrigation, spraying, labor, and their propensity to damage from rain and hail make cherries relatively expensive. Nonetheless, demand is high for the fruit. In commercial production, sour cherries, as well as sweet cherries sometimes, are harvested by using a mechanized \"shaker.\" Hand picking is also widely used for sweet as well as sour cherries to harvest the fruit to avoid damage to both fruit and trees.\nCommon rootstocks include Mazzard, Mahaleb, Colt, and Gisela Series, a dwarfing rootstock that produces trees significantly smaller than others, only 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) tall. Sour cherries require no pollenizer, while few sweet varieties are self-fertile.\nA cherry tree will take three to four years once it is planted in the orchard to produce its first crop of fruit, and seven years to attain full maturity.\n\n\n=== Growing season ===\nLike most temperate-latitude trees, cherry trees require a certain number of chilling hours each year to break dormancy and bloom and produce fruit. The number of chilling hours required depends on the variety. Because of this cold-weather requirement, no members of the genus Prunus can grow in tropical climates. (See \"production\" section for more information on chilling requirements)\nCherries have a short growing season and can grow in most temperate latitudes. Cherries blossom in April (in the Northern Hemisphere) and the peak season for the cherry harvest is in the summer. In southern Europe in June, in North America in June, in England in mid-July, and in southern British Columbia (Canada) in June to mid-August. In many parts of North America, they are among the first tree fruits to flower and ripen in mid-Spring.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, cherries are usually at their peak in late December and are widely associated with Christmas. 'Burlat' is an early variety which ripens during the beginning of December, 'Lapins' ripens near the end of December, and 'Sweetheart' finish slightly later.\n\n\n=== Pests and diseases ===\n\nGenerally, the cherry can be a difficult fruit tree to grow and keep alive.  In Europe, the first visible pest in the growing season soon after blossom (in April in western Europe) usually is the black cherry aphid (\"cherry blackfly,\" Myzus cerasi), which causes leaves at the tips of branches to curl, with the blackfly colonies exuding a sticky secretion which promotes fungal growth on the leaves and fruit. At the fruiting stage in June/July (Europe), the cherry fruit fly (Rhagoletis cingulata and Rhagoletis cerasi) lays its eggs in the immature fruit, whereafter its larvae feed on the cherry flesh and exit through a small hole (about 1 mm diameter), which in turn is the entry point for fungal infection of the cherry fruit after rainfall. In addition, cherry trees are susceptible to bacterial canker, cytospora canker, brown rot of the fruit, root rot from overly wet soil, crown rot, and several viruses.\n\n\n== Cultivars ==\n\nThe following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n\nSee cherry blossom and Prunus for ornamental trees.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn 2020, world production of sweet cherries was 2.61 million tonnes, with Turkey producing 28% of this total. Other major producers of sweet cherries were the United States and Chile. World production of sour cherries in 2020 was 1.48 million tonnes, led by Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Serbia.\n\n\n=== Middle East ===\n\nMajor commercial cherry orchards in West Asia are in Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Azerbaijan.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\nMajor commercial cherry orchards in Europe are in Turkey, Italy, Spain and other Mediterranean regions, and to a smaller extent in the Baltic States and southern Scandinavia.\nIn France since the 1920s, the first cherries of the season come in April/May from the region of C\u00e9ret (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales), where the local producers send, as a tradition since 1932, the first crate of cherries to the president of the Republic.\n\n\n=== North America ===\n\nIn the United States, most sweet cherries are grown in Washington, California, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Important sweet cherry cultivars include Bing, Ulster, Rainier, Brooks, Tulare, King, and Sweetheart. Both Oregon and Michigan provide light-colored 'Royal Ann' ('Napoleon'; alternately 'Queen Anne') cherries for the maraschino cherry process. Most sour (also called tart) cherries are grown in Michigan, followed by Utah, New York, and Washington. Sour cherries include 'Nanking' and 'Evans.' Traverse City, Michigan is called the \"Cherry Capital of the World\", hosting a National Cherry Festival and making the world's largest cherry pie. The specific region of northern Michigan known for tart cherry production is referred to as the \"Traverse Bay\" region.\nMost cherry varieties have a chilling requirement of 800 or more hours, meaning that in order to break dormancy, blossom, and set fruit, the winter season needs to have at least 800 hours where the temperature is below 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F). \"Low chill\" varieties requiring 300 hours or less are Minnie Royal and Royal Lee, requiring cross-pollinization, whereas the cultivar, Royal Crimson, is self-fertile.  These varieties extend the range of cultivation of cherries to the mild winter areas of southern US. This is a boon to California producers of sweet cherries, as California is the second largest producer of sweet cherries in the US.\nNative and non-native sweet cherries grow well in Canada's provinces of Ontario and British Columbia where an annual cherry festival has been celebrated for seven consecutive decades in the Okanagan Valley town of Osoyoos. In addition to the Okanagan, other British Columbia cherry growing regions are the Similkameen Valley and Kootenay Valley, all three regions together producing 5.5 million kg annually or 60% of total Canadian output. Sweet cherry varieties in British Columbia include 'Rainier', 'Van', 'Chelan', 'Lapins', 'Sweetheart', 'Skeena', 'Staccato', 'Christalina' and 'Bing.'\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, cherries are grown in all the states except for the Northern Territory.  The major producing regions are located in the temperate areas within New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.  Western Australia has limited production in the elevated parts in the southwest of the state.  Key production areas include Young, Orange and Bathurst in New South Wales, Wandin, the Goulburn and Murray valley areas in Victoria, the Adelaide Hills region in South Australia, and the Huon and Derwent Valleys in Tasmania.\nKey commercial varieties in order of seasonality include 'Empress', 'Merchant', 'Supreme', 'Ron's seedling', 'Chelan', 'Ulster', 'Van', 'Bing', 'Stella', 'Nordwunder', 'Lapins', 'Simone', 'Regina', 'Kordia' and 'Sweetheart'.  New varieties are being introduced, including the late season 'Staccato' and early season 'Sequoia'.  The Australian Cherry Breeding program is developing a series of new varieties which are under testing evaluation.\nThe New South Wales town of Young is called the \"Cherry Capital of Australia\" and hosts the National Cherry Festival.\n\n\n== Nutritional value ==\nRaw sweet cherries are 82% water, 16% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and negligible in fat (table). As raw fruit, sweet cherries provide little nutrient content per 100 g serving, as only dietary fiber and vitamin C are present in moderate content, while other vitamins and dietary minerals each supply less than 10% of the Daily Value (DV) per serving, respectively (table).\nCompared to sweet cherries, raw sour cherries contain 50% more vitamin C per 100 g (12% DV) and about 20 times more vitamin A (8% DV), beta-Carotene in particular (table).\n\n\n=== Health risks ===\nThe cherry kernels, accessible by chewing or breaking the hard-shelled cherry pits, contain amygdalin, a chemical that releases the toxic compound hydrogen cyanide when ingested. The amount of amygdalin in each cherry varies widely, and symptoms would show only after eating several crushed pits (3\u20134 of the Morello variety or 7\u20139 of the red or black varieties). Swallowing the pits whole normally causes no complications.\n\n\n== Other uses ==\n\nCherry wood is valued for its rich color and straight grain in manufacturing fine furniture, particularly desks, tables and chairs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCherry ice cream\nCherry juice\nCherry pit oil\nCherry pitter\nDried cherry\nList of Award of Garden Merit flowering cherries\nList of cherry dishes\nMahleb, a spice made out of cherry seeds (found within cherry pits)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Data related to Prunus subg.
